Rethink how we are doing this.  Instead of building a standalone
app for all of the user interface crap, why not use the web browser
as our interface.  If we do this, our architecture can be:

 Build in web active-x component to traditional app.
 	- How do we handle form input?  
	- There is a MS IE HtmlWidget as well as a Mozilla one.
	
 Use the straight browser and communicate with a server running
 locally.  
	- Shows up as localhost:1234.
	- Must be started as a separate step
	- Requires an html server software plus all of the usual CGI.
	- More difficult for novice users
	- Trivial to deploy on a real website
