VueScan calibration differs from Minolta calibration. I don't know all
differences, but my tests have shown that Minolta calibration doesn't
move the CCD while calibrating where VueScan does. Also, Minolta
procedure sets max black and white per CCD line separately. VueScan
seems to do this in one go. When your lamp has become too old the
Minolta calibration procedure will make a warning LED blink or give a
warning onscreen. VueScan will accept much lower light emmitting from
your lamp. I don't even know if it will ever decide for a lamp
replacement.

Anyway, the shortcuts only work with the Minolta software, not with
VueScan. What you can do to force the scanner to do a recalibration is
turn it off an immediately on again after the preheating period of 20
minutes. The scanner will perform a Minolta calibration then, after
which you can apply a VueScan one as well.

Vuescan Notes

     What ? You don't use Vuescan ? Go download it from Ed's website now. 
     When scanning negatives, sometimes I get extremely noisy backgrounds, the dark areas are redish with a lot of noise that looks more like film grain than
     scanner noise. Using multipass does not make much difference, but setting the RGB exposure manually to a higher value seems to help, although it
     increases the duration of the scan.. 
     Increasing the RGB value (5 to 30) is also a good way to scan dark slides, like night pictures. Probably better to associate it with Multipass too. 
     With negative films, the color balance / RGB whatever is automatically determined from the cropped area of the selection. In other words, if you select even
     the white borders of the scan, then the color rendition of the final scan will be quite different than what you saw on the preview. To avoid this, select only the
     useful area. 
     When scanning Black & White negative, use the white point and black point parameters to perfect the contrast of the image. Their default values are
     respectively 1 and 0. 
     After the scan is over, use you favorite photo-editing software to remove the dust, fingerprints, hairs, and fluffs that are always present on slides. The
     appropriate function is called 'clone brush' in most programs. To ensure superior results, after you think you've removed it all, negate your image and look
     again... 
     I have compiled the help file of VueScan into a more convenient .chm file (Windows only). Download it (133Kb) and use it instead, so you can search the
     text. It correspond to Vuescan version 7.5.56.
